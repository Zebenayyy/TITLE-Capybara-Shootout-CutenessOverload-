In this multiplayer, capybara shoot-out game, the players must avoid one anothers flower bullets. Each hit results in depletion of their health. (idk how many times they get shot until they die) To restore their health, there will be boosters such as hearts for the capybaras to collect as they glide up and down the screen. 



USER INPUT:Users are going to use their keyboard in order to navigate their character, to collect boosters, and avoid being hit by one another. 
GAME OVER:The game is over when one of the users has gotten hit over a certain amount of times. Doing so will result in a game over screen. 
GRAPHICS/IMAGES:  Images such as a meadow, Capybaras, flower bullets, hearts, and other tiny details will be used to bring the game to life.
. 


HEALTH BAR: the bar shrinks each time a player gets hit by a bullet. When the bar of one of the players fully depletes, the game terminates. However, the bar replenishes and extends to its maximum length when a capybara is able to obtain a booster. 
MULTIPLAYER/ENEMIES: Since the game is between two players, the enemies are one another.
COLLECTABLES: there will be boosters in the form of hearts to replenish their health. 
SPRITE ANIMATION: 2D Animation is used to showcase the capybara turning its back, left and right, as well as dying. 


CHANGES: The overall changes made is the type of game we are creating as previously we made a single player, maze-like game.
